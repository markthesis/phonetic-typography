# Phonetic Typography

Phonetic Typography explores the relationship between speech and typography 		through computational and interactive design. By incorporating how a sentence is 	spoken into its typographic form, this project aims to let typography stand on its 		own without the aid of imagery or sound. 

In our digital age, sentences and words inherently lose a part of their meaning 		when translated directly into characters on a screen. This has led to changes in the 	way we communicate digitally. Meme and GIF culture is flourishing, where type is 	accompanied by still or moving imagery in order to fully convey its intended 		meaning. The presence of millions of typefaces, each with their own personalities 	and forms, also speak to this phenomenon. Typography is failing in its ability to fully 	convey human emotion and intention on its own.

Through the creation of an interactive program that can automatically capture 		tonality of voice into typographic forms, this project aims to create a new tool that 	can help typography carry meaning in a more effective way, reducing the 	need to 	supplement it with other forms of communication. By varying typographic forms with 	sound waves, users can see how a sentence is being said just by looking at it, 		allowing the words to speak for themselves.
